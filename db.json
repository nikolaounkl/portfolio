        "interests": "Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors (well...as long the weather allows it!). With my wife we love travelling and discovering the nature. Hiking, basketball and tennis are some of my favourite activities. In the cold winter days, Netflix, NBA and cooking are the antidotes. I'm born and raised in Athens Greece, which means... cooking delicious Greek food is my duty! I'm a BIG fan of TESLA & SpaceX and in general I like researching about new technologies that can improve our life quality & change the way we see our world!"
