                        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my
                        time being outdoors (well...as long the weather allows
                        it!). With my wife we love travelling and discovering
                        the nature. Hiking, swimming, basketball and tennis are
                        some of my favourite activities during the warm months!.
                        In the cold winter days, Netflix, Liverpool FC & NBA are
                        the antidotes. I love Greek food... and the kitchen is
                        my kingdom!
