                        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my
                        time being outdoors (well...as long the weather allows
                        it!). <br />
                        With my wife we love travelling and discovering the
                        nature. <br />
                        Hiking, swimming, basketball and tennis are some of myd
                        favourite activities during the warm months!. <br />
                        In the cold winter days, Netflix, Liverpool FC & NBA are
                        the antidotes. <br />
                        I'm born and raised in Athens, Greece, which means...
                        cooking delicious Greek food is my duty!
