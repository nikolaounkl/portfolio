        "about_text_1": "I had the chance to be part of cross functional teams which I believe made me a cool team player, being comfortable in putting my hands in both front-end and back-end projects but as well helped me crystalize my strong passion for front-end development of web apps.",
        "about_text_2": "Front-end development is my main area of expertise, where I try to combine creativity with simplicity. My goal is always to be able to write maintainable, clean code with a strong focus on cross-device & browsers optimisation and user's experience / value. With a continued desire for learning more about modern front-end frameworks and libraries, I try to improve myself and my daily workflow.",
        "interests": "Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors (well...as long the weather allows it!). With my wife we love travelling and discovering the nature. Hiking, basketball and tennis are some of my favourite activities. In the cold winter days, Netflix, NBA and cooking are the antidotes. I'm born and raised in Athens Greece, which means... cooking delicious Greek food is my duty! I'm a BIG fan of TESLA & SpaceX and in general I like researching about new technologies that can improve our life quality & change the way we see our world!"
